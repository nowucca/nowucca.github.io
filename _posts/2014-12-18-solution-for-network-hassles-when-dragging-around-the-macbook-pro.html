<p>I drag around my MacBook Pro to different networks every day.</p>
<p>Sometimes, there are hassles connecting to a network, wired or wifi.</p>
<p>This little script can be used to kick the network interfaces a little bit to potentially fix strange states they find themselves in:</p>
<p>{% highlight bash linenos %}<br />
$ for if in $(ifconfig -l)<br />
do<br />
  sudo ifconfig $if down<br />
  sudo ifconfig $if up<br />
done<br />
{% endhighlight %}</p>
