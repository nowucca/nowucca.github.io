<p>How can you remotely debug a JVM with an initialization erorr in your application?</p>
<p>The normal debug JVM parameters require you to attach really quickly:<br />
-Xdebug -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=5005 -Xmx512m</p>
<p>By making suspend=y,timeout=5000 the JVM waits 5 seconds for an attach.<br />
-Xdebug -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,server=y,address=5005,suspend=y,timeout=5000 -Xmx512m</p>
<p>This made it easier to get to my IDE to attach the debugger and still have the initialization code breakpoints get triggered.</p>
