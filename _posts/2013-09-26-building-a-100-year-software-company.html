<p>Some Silicon Valley software companies,  like Evernote most prominently, have declared that they want to be 100-year companies.  For Evernote, that helps their business and "elephant never forgets" strategy/moniker.  But that made me remember an adage that I heard about Netscape that was generalized into the statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>Software companies have a 7 year lifespan, before their tools, technology or technical debt cripple them.</p></blockquote>
<p>Do you think that is true?  The more interesting question might be - if you were to start a software company with the goal of longevity what decisions would you make differently than where you work now?</p>
