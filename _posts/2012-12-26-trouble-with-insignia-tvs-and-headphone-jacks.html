<p>If you own an Insignia LDVD-26 model, and your internal speakers are not disabled when using headphone jacks, this note is for you.</p>
<p>It turns out that some of these models need to be reset to factory settings in the TV menu, in the settings tab.  Reset to factory specs there and now the internal speakers ARE disabled when using headphones.</p>
<p>Good for late night gaming to not disturb the kids!</p>
