# IntelliJ Tips and Slightly Less Common Key Mappings

## August 2020 IntelliJ Tips

* To disable the annoying browser icons in the editor:  Go to Preferences / Tools / Web Browsers, disable them all.  See [this article](https://intellij-support.jetbrains.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/206999745-Is-there-a-way-to-hide-the-floating-browser-icons-) for details.

## Keyboard shortcuts to remember

* `^-G`, select current element, repeated presses perform multi-selects
* `^-Shift-G`: deselects, repeated presses perform de-selects
* `⌘ -^-G`: multi select current element in the current file for quick renaming

* `⌘-Shift-Return` to complete statement structurally you are in

* When you have a popup list use `↦` (tab) not enter.  We overwrite and replace in completion lists (saves one having to delete the existing word).

* `⌘-Shift -I`: to see the code for the variable at the caret

## Some Suggested Remappings
*  Jump to Source instead of `F4` use `⌥-S`
* Go to next error in file instead of `F2` use `^-E`
* `⌘-F1` to show error info use `^-⌘-E`
* `⌘-F12` show file structure `^-⌥-S`)
* To Evaluate Expression = `^-X`
* Debug Step over `^-/`, Step Into `^-.`, Step Out `^-'`, Run `^-,`

* Navigate via word under caret replacing `F3`
	*  `^-L` Next occurrence of word
	* `Shift-^-L` Previous occurrence of word,
	* `⌘-L`  next occurrence of word
