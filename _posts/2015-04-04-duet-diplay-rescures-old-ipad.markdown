title:  "Duet Display can Rescuse Your Old iPad"

So yesterday I found the [iPadDock][iPadDockHome] from SLK Electronics and picked one up for my old iPad2.
It's been sitting around gathering dust after I finished a couple of Fifa 14 seasons on it.

Now, thanks to the dock and [Duet Display][duetDisplayHome] it's a working monitor next to my 2 thunderbolt displays in my office.

I've yet to discover what the best use case is, but I'm starting to think that since it's at my peripheral vision, I'm going to use it for our team HipChat.
