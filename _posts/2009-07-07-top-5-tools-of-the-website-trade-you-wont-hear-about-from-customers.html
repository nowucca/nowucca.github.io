<p>What are the tools of the trade that you will never see in a product requirements document or feature request from an investor or client?</p>
<p>Clients often just expect that certain things are taken care of when building a web site.  These tools of the trade are important -  they are ubiquitous across systems, and often we use the cheaper tools to start with and then switch over (re-tool) during the course of business growth.  Over the course of the next few posts, I'm going to briefly develop what I think are the Top 5 tools of the trade for a software engineer working on a website, from the point of the view that your customers will never ask for them, but they are almost always required and even assumed.</p>
<p>I'm going to try to consider this in a language-neutral way and stick with general principles or ideas.  Stay tuned!</p>
