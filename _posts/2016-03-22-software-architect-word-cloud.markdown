Thanks to [Wordle](http://wordle.net) I gathered up text from a bunch of LinkedIn software architect job listings and created the
word cloud below.  The idea would be to see what words to make sure you use in your own LinkedIn profile if you were looking
for a job.

I almost think that looking at some of the smaller words at the fringes might make more sense (e.g. "delivering, reliable").
