<p>Installed Apache, configured your DNS but STILL having trouble accessing your domain at slicehost?  You probably need to adjust your iptables (firewall) rules.</p>
<p>This article really helped me understand iptables at a very basic level.  It's been a couple of years since I really delved into linux and things have become really nice.</p>
<p>I also found out that slicehost correctly configures your firewall pretty tight, allowing new connections for ssl only.  Wow, another thing done right at slicehost!</p>
