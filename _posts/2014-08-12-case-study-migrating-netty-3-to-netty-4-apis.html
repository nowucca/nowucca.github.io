<p>In this blog post I walk through some of the issues I encountered when upgrading a customer socket server with a custom socket protocol from Netty 3 to Netty 4 high performance Java networking library.</p>
<p>Firstly I recommend you read the<a href="http://netty.io/wiki/user-guide-for-4.x.html"> guide for the basics of Netty 4</a>.</p>
<p>The following are some of the more obvious areas of difference from Netty 3:</p>
<ul class="task-list">
<li>new EventLoopGroup initialization, with listeners looks cleaner and keeps client/server differences minimal</li>
<li>No more need to releaseExternalResources</li>
<li>Use writeAndFlush not write - flushes need to be explicit</li>
<li>messages need to be "released", the new SimpleUpstreamHandlers do this automatically but if not using those pay attention to releasing messages.</li>
<li>Use ByteUtil for some operations previously found in ChannelHandlers</li>
</ul>
