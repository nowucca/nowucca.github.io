<p>What are the tools of the trade that you will never see in a product requirements document or feature request from an investor or client?</p>
<p>Clients often just expect that certain things are taken care of when building a web site.  These tools of the trade are important -  often we use the cheaper tools to start with a switch over (re-tool) during the course of business growth.  Over the course of the next few days, I'm going to briefly develop what I think are the Top 5 tools of the trade for a software engineer working on a website, that your customers will never ask for.</p>
<p>I'm going to try to consider this in a language-neutral way and stick with general principles or ideas.</p>
<p>Tool of the Trade 1: Testing Tools and Strategy</p>
<p>Is a customer ever going to tell you how to test your software - they just assume you will test it and it will work.  A testing strategy is always worth considering first when building a website.  <a href="http://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2009/5/24633-logic-of-lemmings-in-compiler-innovation/fulltext" target="_blank">Especially if you are using a dynamic language as your server-side request handler</a>.  Let's face it - it is not sexy or cool to manually or automatically run a bunch of test cases  against your system.  But considering the question of how to test effectively can tell you a lot about the nature of your system at a macro-level - something good to be conscious of continuously that often is not.  A pedantic regime of regression tests only very rarely assists with showing real surprises; too pedantic and your large test suite is wastefully expensive, but too frivolous and you are going to need a customer support team - if you are lucky and don't crash hard!</p>
<p>Here are some key decision points for developing a testing strategy and choosing the appropriate tools; the decision points really help you make a few tradeoffs from the start.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>What test environments does the organization require?</em> Many companies establish development, testing and production infrastructures, replicating the database and applications in each environment.  This allows development, testing and the live site to be used independently and concurrently.  Often this is accompanied by a regime of either recreating or refreshing the development and testing databases on a schedule.  All of this can be expensive and may grow over time as the site grows.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><em>Do I require automated testing at all?</em> It is surprising how far you can get with no automated testing regime at all.  It requires a level of attention not usually required of QA engineers, and perhaps a funded customer support channel as a backup, but it can be a legitimate business decision for the short to medium term.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><em>What styles of automated testing are available to me?</em> I have seen testing regimes that start with black-box testing, record/playback automated black box, intelligent UI-agnostic form-aware link-aware automated black box, in-container request/response testing, integration testing of a unified business layer, integration testing of a module collection, unit-tests for a module and unit tests for some classes.  I don't think any of them scale particularly well.  Right now you are better off choosing those that match your design the most, remembering not to be too pedantic about testing.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><em>Do I need a layered code design or is a flatter design acceptable?</em> Often we start by building a typical 3-tier (MVC)-presentation, Services and Data-Access layered system for websites.  If it is a quick and dirty site, this may not be the most productive use of your time (have to edit multiple files, follow a process for feature development).   Perhaps it's ok to rely on refactoring when and if the site grows?  Until then, only share code when completely obvious.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><em>How am I going to keep the test cycle fast and efficient?</em> Whether you are performing automated testing or not, it will be worth considering what the workflow of QA engineers will be.  Often they will be heavy users of a bug system, issuetracking system for support and good ones will be clients of the production databases for troubleshooting and ad-hoc queries.  Determination of the test cycle workflow will also impact what your release cycle can be.  Shorter is sweeter.  At a technical level, one can also consider using mock objects to make the tests run fast.</li>
</ul>
<p>Testing strategies can help define how business resources are used, the tone of the company and the release cycle for your software.  The consideration of testing processes is a vital tool in the construction of websites (and software) - one which many business owners will implicitly require.</p>
<p>Tool of the Trade 2: Software Design Guidelines</p>
<p>Design guidelines are critical for a successful software project.  No customer will ever demand this directly, but the feeling you get from the codebase in conjunction with the team's feelings about it really matters!</p>
<p>I've seen alot of different attitudes to design 'guidelines', mostly to do with the level of enforcement.  When guidelines become enforced, the resulting software can be beautifully conceptually elegant.  When guidelines are not enforced, the resulting software can be a dumpling soup of dependencies (that is, code that looks like it's separated into distinct globs but it all falls apart if you pick one thing up).  The best advice I can offer here is that guidelines work when the organically easiest thing to do is to follow the patterns, at least well enough to preserve the macro picture.</p>
<p>I think there is a design at two levels for software - a macro and micro.  Macro level design has to do with technology choices and data flow.  Micro-design has to do with code organization and dependencies within the macro bounds.  It's really important for a team to agree on the <em><strong>feeling</strong></em> of a software system design at both these levels; that is to have a basic idea that we are all painting a landscape and not a Cubist.</p>
<p>Tool of the Trade 3: Software Utilities</p>
<p>There is a whole class of software solutions, usually called 'utilities', that seem to be required wherever you work, in whatever runtime system you have.  For websites, I have a small list of utility classes that I usually develop or find equivalents for</p>
<p>- Link generator: How does the website generate links, secured when needed?  Often a URL builder in one form or another that can deal with URI encoding is needed.</p>
<p>- Tracers, Counters, Logging Subsystem: It's really important to have a standard set of abstractions to measure timings, log events and even just count how many times a code path is executed.  This will be invaluable performance measurement and debugging infrastructure that can grow as your site does.  Even the simplest site can benefit from logging.</p>
<p>- Secure tokens: This is a strange one that only recently became apparent to me - you will be generating 'tokens', sending them out into the real world, and when you get them back you will be tying them up to some authentication purpose.  Additional requirements are often that they can be versioned, are valid for a certain period of time and can be individually, by category or globally revoked. I've built and seen about 7 of these systems, and often you build it more than once within a company!</p>
<p>- Encryption libraries: You are going to need a hardware or software solution for storing sensitive data, and for digesting data.  Usually a combination of both hardware and software for the appropriately paranoid.  If you even think of storing an encrypted password, rather than a digest of it, you'll probably want to protect it in memory using software and/or get it encrypted to disk as soon as possible.  Either way, I'm sure we've all written wrappers around core encryption libraries in the past - you'll want this in your toolchest.</p>
<p>Tool of the Trade 4: Standard Security Solutions</p>
<p>XSRF and the <a href="http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Top_Ten_Project" target="_blank">Top 10</a></p>
<p>Authentication regime</p>
<p>Authorization regime</p>
<p>- Mention AppFuse and other generator technology</p>
<p>- Mention recognition/authentication design for a membership-based site</p>
<p>Tool of the Trade 5: Off-the-Shelf Components</p>
