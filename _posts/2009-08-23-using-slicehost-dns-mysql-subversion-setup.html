<p>I bought a slice on slicehost since I had heard good things.</p>
<p>This morning in 2 hours I have a running mysql and subbversion daemon and have pointed one of my domain names to the sliced host.  I used the Fedora 11 image, mainly because I think at work we will be going with that distribution, no other reason.</p>
<p>I learned that yum is a great package manager to use with Fedora.</p>
<p>Here are some links that got me going along the way.</p>
