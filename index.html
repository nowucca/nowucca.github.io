  <p>
  nowucca is short for "no worries", and typifies the sort of self-reliant good-natured get-stuff-done mentality that I strive to bring to my life whenever possible.
  </p>

  <p>this site captures some professional thoughts and random stuff that happens in my life as a software developer and technologist.  it serves as a sort of memory of my working life along with some other thoughts that spring to mind from a technology or sometimes personal perspective.</p>
