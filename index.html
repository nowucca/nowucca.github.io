  <h1 class="page-heading">What is nowucca.com?</h1>

  <p>
  nowucca is short for "no worries" in Australian slang. It typifies the sort of self-reliant get-stuff-done mentality that I strive to bring to my software development whenever possible.
  </p>

  <p>This site captures some professional thoughts and random stuff that happens in my life as a software developer and technologist.  it serves as a sort of memory of my working life along with some other thoughts that spring to mind from a technology or sometimes personal perspective.</p>
