I've been working as a software engineer in Silicon Valley for the last 15 years. During that time, I've worked for a few startups and seen failure, acquisition and LinkedIn going IPO. My main strengths right now are in Java backend programming, digital security, and subsystem design and development.

When I do evaluate companies, I look for a staff engineering or lead position that has a fun engineering process, challenging problems of scale for a back-end engineer, some front-end work, and a great team of collaborative genuine people. I'm looking for a culture that's WELL outside the norm for larger software companies.

I hold a Ph.D. in Computer Science and Electrical Engineering from the University of Queensland. You can read my Ph.D. thesis and browse publications [here][my-publications].

In a previous life as a budding academic, I was an advocate for formal methods in software development. I worked with people at the Object-Z and RESOLVE communities, making research techniques more practical. I still am an advocate for formal methods, for the masses, but without language and tool support, its a losing battle.  Taking some of the best thought from the RESOLVE community with respect to proof obligation generation and teaming that up with the theorem proving community at SRI (PVS) or the old [Software Verification Research Centre][svrc-home] Ergo theorem prover would be an avenue of research I'd like to see pursued.
