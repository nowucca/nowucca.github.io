<p>I  am a software engineer working in Silicon Valley.  I worked on LinkedIn during its infancy, and at Netflix and am currently at Kaazing.com.</p>
<p>Please visit <a href="http://steven.atkinson.net">http://steven.atkinson.net</a> for more details.</p>
<p>This blog started as a way of publishing something to my Linkedin profile when they added the WordPress application to allow it.  I'm using it as a way of journalling some of the interesting things I learn along the road from work and browsing around.</p>
<p>This is a personal blog and as such all opinions expressed are my own.</p>
