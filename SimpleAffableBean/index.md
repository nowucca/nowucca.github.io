The Simple Affable Bean project source code is located on [GitHub][2].

The project is ready for deployment on an EJB server as it stands.

* [Slides][1] are available for guiding installation of this original Affable Bean EJB application using IntelliJ, JBoss EAP / Wildfly and MySQL

* [Datasource Setup for Intellij][3] slides are available to show how IntelliJ can access mysql directly.

The intention is to soon move away from this EJB implementation to a simpler one based on raw JDBC and without the use of EJBs.
