<p>I've been working as a software engineer in Silicon Valley for the last 11 years.
During that time, I've worked for three startups, and seen failure, acquisition and LinkedIn going IPO. My main strengths right now are in Java backend programming, digital security, SQL and feature development. I have done and would like to do more Ajax/CSS/HTML5 work, as well as learn other dynamic languages such as ruby or python.</p>

<p><strong>Although I am not currently looking for another position, I do like to hear about exciting new companies that are close to Morgan Hill. If your opportunity is north of Mountain View, I am not interested</strong>.  When I do evaluate companies, I look for an engineering or lead position that has a fun engineering process, challenging problems of scale for a back-end engineer, some front-end work, and a great team of collaborative genuine people.</p>

<p>To find out more about my professional life, visit <a href="https://stevenatkinson.wordpress.com">my blog</a>, visit <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/satkinson">my LinkedIn profile</a> or see my <a href="work.html">work experience</a> on this site. </p>

<p>I hold a Ph.D. in Computer Science and Electrical Engineering from the University of Queensland.  You can read my <a href="pubs/thesis-final.ps.gz">Ph.D. thesis</a> and browse <a href="pubs/index.html">publications</a> here.

<p>In a previous life as a budding academic, I was an advocate for formal methods in software development. 
I worked with people at the Object-Z and RESOLVE communities, making research techniques more practical. 
I still am an advocate for formal methods, but without language and tool support, its a losing battle.</p>
