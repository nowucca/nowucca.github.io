<strong> Formal Engineering of Software Library Systems</strong><p>
<strong>  Abstract: </strong>
The reuse of complete software developments and the processes used to
create them has the potential to significantly ease the process of
software engineering, by providing a source of verified software
artefacts.<P>

Software libraries are collections of software artefacts which have
been aggregated to form a resource-rich environment, from which
software engineers can reuse the efforts of others during subsequent
software development.  By storing such information, software libraries
serve as a vehicle for the exchange of ideas and experience between
software engineers.<P>

It is argued that reuse of software artefacts can be achieved through
the utilisation of software libraries.  However, software library
systems are not yet common or mature phenomena, and as such are
themselves candidates for software engineering analysis.<P>

The goal of this thesis is to provide a reasoned formal specification
of a software library system, to serve as a precise, clear context in
which to analyse and discuss general software library structures and
processes.  This yields a formal basis for the continuing development
of software library designs and implementations, promoting the
development of new reuse-oriented software engineering techniques.<P>

Through formalisation of software libraries, deficiencies of existing
software libraries are identified, suggesting new ways of modelling
library artefacts and operations.  As the new models are developed,
processes for formulating library policies are proposed.
A library of object-oriented class declarations is also
developed to serve as an illustration of the new models and processes.<P>

Ultimately, the formal specifications and processes gathered together
in this thesis form a coherent description of software library
systems.  This promotes the effective reuse of software artefacts by
providing a more formal structure for their storage and dissemination.

<strong> Cognitive Deficiencies in Software Library Design </strong><p>
<strong>  Abstract: </strong>
If the role of software libraries is to communicate information about
software artefacts between software engineers, it is vital that the
information be stored in such a manner as to be readily
understandable.  The designs of existing software libraries present
several cognitive impediments to a software engineer, hindering the
understanding of library organisation and content.

In this paper, a focused review of existing software libraries is
undertaken.  Shortcomings of the designs of existing software
libraries and resulting cognitive deficiencies are identified.  The
design problems to be discussed are: the hiding of underlying library
structure, the inadequacy of component interfaces, the problems of
querying large collections, and the subjective nature of component
organisation.  Having encountered these problems with existing
software libraries, some avenues for alleviating them are identified.<P>

<strong> Examining Behavioural Retrieval </strong><p>

<strong>  Abstract: </strong>
The challenge of software reuse is to record software development
knowledge in such a way that it is readily stored digitally and easily
retrieved, understood and used by other software engineers.  Hence at the
highest level, the process of retrieval from a repository is to take a
description of a problem, and search for stored
knowledge which may help to solve the described problem.

The purpose of component retrieval is therefore concerned with
finding component behaviours which solve a problem described by a query.
Most proposed component retrieval schemes simulate
this search for desired behaviour, either by using text-based,
vocabulary classification, structural matching or specification
matching techniques.  Of course, most retrieval schemes also consider
contextual aspects, such as resource usage, efficiency and
internal representation.

A theoretical definition of behavioural retrieval is required to
describe the ideal (modulo contextual aspects) retrieval scheme,
despite its probable inefficiency in practice.  In this paper a
theoretical definition of behavioural retrieval is outlined, showing
that useful, exploitable structure does exist in behaviour.<P>

<strong> A Formal Model for Integrated Retrieval from Software Libraries </strong><P>

<strong> Abstract: </strong>
The central problem associated with libraries of object-oriented
software components is that of retrieval: how to find in the library
those components that can be used in the construction of a particular
application.  Approaches to this problem can be classified into three
categories based upon the way components are represented: external
classification, structural matching and behavioural.  The aim of the
research described in this paper is to unify these existing approaches
to the component retrieval problem into a formally specified
object-oriented framework, providing a model enabling comparison and
description of integrated retrieval schemes.<P>

<strong> Abstract: </strong> 
The reuse of complete software developments and the processes used

software engineering, by providing a source of verified software
artifacts.  It is suggested that reuse of software artifacts can be
achieved through the utilization of software libraries. However,
software library systems are not yet common or mature phenomena, and
as such are themselves candidates for the application of requirements
analysis, formal specification, design and other software engineering
activities.  A more formal approach to the analysis of software
library requirements and their specification will provide a basis for
the development of useful software libraries.<P>

<strong> 
A Unifying Model for Retrieval from Reusable Software Libraries
</strong><P>

<strong> Abstract: </strong> 
The central problem associated with libraries of reusable software
components is that of retrieval: how to find in the library those
components that can be used in the construction of a particular
application.  There have been three major proposed solutions
to this problem: faceted (classification), signature-matching
(structural) and behavioural (functional) retrieval.
The aim of this paper is to unify these existing approaches to
the component retrieval problem into a formally specified framework,
providing a model upon which meaningful comparisons are made and principles
formulated.<P>

<strong>
Formalizing the Proposed Eiffel Library Kernel Standard
</strong><P>

<strong> Abstract: </strong> 
The Proposed Eiffel Library Kernel Standard has been created for
the purpose of promoting multi-platform interoperability using the
Eiffel language.  It consists of a set of twenty class specifications,
called the library kernel, which serve as a benchmark
against which proposed library implementations can be tested for
compatibility with the standard.  The rules for kernel compatibility
should be clear and unambiguous in order to ensure that the
interoperability sought is not compromised.  A formal specification
language offers the precision and degree of confidence required. This
paper presents a model of the Proposed Eiffel Library Kernel Standard
in the formal specification language Object-Z, which has been
advocated for the specification of standards.<P>

<strong>
     A Methodology for Behavioural Retrieval from Class Libraries
</strong><P>

<strong> Abstract: </strong> 
The central problem associated with libraries of reusable software
components such as classes is that of retrieval: how to find in the
library those classes that can be used in the construction of a
particular application.  At the heart of class retrieval is the issue
of behaviour: to decide if a library class is appropriate for a
particular application it is necessary to know how objects of that
class behave, i.e. how they react when sent messages by their
environment.  In this paper a methodology for searching libraries to
find classes whose objects behave in some specified manner is defined.
In general, it will not be possible to find a class whose objects
behave exactly as required.  In this case the methodology
finds classes whose objects best approximate the specified behaviour
in a precisely defined sense.  The aim is to retrieve classes that can
be easily modified to define objects that behave exactly as required.<P>

<strong>
 An open architecture object store system for persistent abstract
  syntax trees 
</strong> <P>

<strong> Abstract: </strong> 
Researchers in the field of software re-engineering have recognised
that transformations acting upon the abstract
syntax trees of source programs are a useful method of
preserving the semantics of program constructs whilst
changing the language in which they are expressed.
Software re-engineering environments will therefore require infrastructure
support for storing abstract syntax trees.  This report describes
the development of an open architecture object store system which
provides this support, and then demonstrates how the openness of the system
allows communication of abstract syntax structures between the system and
multiple external languages.<P>
