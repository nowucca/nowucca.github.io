                <p>How do you discern a quality apartment 
                from one frought with problems??</p>
                <p>Here is a checklist of potential pitfalls and pluses.</p>
                <p>(Source: 'The Domain' Sydney Morning Herald, July 19, 2001)</p>
                <h2><a name="Construction">Construction</a></h2>
                <p>Acoustics are a major issue in new apartments, To check the 
                quality of the acoustics, try arming yourself with a ghetto 
                blaster in a neighboring apartment. &nbsp;Or, sit quietly in 
                the early evening and if you can hear your neighbours, worry. 
                &nbsp;If buying off the plan, you should ask the developer for 
                a guarantee of the target acoustic rating &quot;as built&quot;. 
                &nbsp;Then employ an acoustic engineer to test it.</p>
                <p>General construction problems: look for cracks, damp or signs 
                of movement in the building. &nbsp;Foor and walls should appear 
                plumb. &nbsp;Look, too, for any variations in the rendering. 
                &nbsp;Just about anything outside that is higher than inside, 
                like a planter or balcony is a potential water entry from above. 
                &nbsp;Garden beds on balconies and roofs need careful waterproofing. 
                &nbsp;</p>
                <p>You should get a building inspection. &nbsp;With off-the-plan 
                apartments, go in and do a defects list before you settle. &nbsp;Providing 
                you're fair and reasonable, most builders will be happy to fix 
                problems. &nbsp;</p>
                <p>The #1 concern is the developer. &nbsp;Do they have a track 
                record? &nbsp;Visiting other properties by the same developer/builder 
                team is a canny move; it displays a physical track record and 
                how the work waers with time. &nbsp;Make sure the builders have 
                insurance, so if there is a problem, it can be fixed. &nbsp;For 
                an off-the-plan apartment, the Dept of Fair Trading says the 
                developer should attach a certificate showing home warranty 
                insurance at settlement.</p>
                <h2><a name="Plumbing and Electricity">Plumbing and Electricity</a></h2>
                <p>Here are a few quick tests to identify potential problem 
                areas: turn all taps on and off quickly; if there is a thunking 
                sound the plumbing joints will probably crack or lossen within 
                3 to 5 years. &nbsp;Check water pressure and temperature by 
                turning on several taps at once. &nbsp;Flush toilets then check 
                to see if they have shut off properly and don't leak.</p>
                <p>There can also be air-conditioning malfunctions. &nbsp;Get 
                the acoustics on air conditioners check professionally. &nbsp;Electrical 
                problems are less common, but you can test all fittings with 
                a powerpoint tester, available at most hardware stores. &nbsp;It 
                will pick up hitches, such as a point that is not properly earthed.</p>
                <h2><a name="Fittings and Materials">Fittings and Materials</a></h2>
                <p>Fittings and materials should be of a reasonable quality, 
                though this will vary according to budget and the developer. 
                &nbsp;Don't assume quality just because you have paid a high 
                price. &nbsp;Most complaints to the Dept of Fair Trading concern 
                the quality of finishes such as the bathroom and kitchen fittings. 
                &nbsp;Consumer often have unrealistic expectations &quot;heightened 
                by the glossy promotional material&quot; and sales agents &quot;spiel&quot;. 
                &nbsp;Most off-the-plan purchases include a clause allowing 
                the builder/developer a 5% variation of floorplans or materials. 
                &nbsp;This provides a fair amount of leeway, so enlist a lawyer 
                experienced in off-the-plan sales and have inclusions and fittings 
                detailed into a contract, the Dept Fair Trading advises. &nbsp;</p>
                <p>If the apartment is already finished, check windows and doors: 
                a quality sliding door will move easily and the seal is good 
                if it cuts out noise and draft. &nbsp;The same applies to windows. 
                &nbsp;Swing a door; it should feel solid, heavy, not light. 
                &nbsp;Open cupboards and check the quality of the joinery. &nbsp;Get 
                a feel - has someone taken a bit of care? &nbsp;What will it 
                look like in 10-15 years?</p>
                <h2><a name="Floorplan">Floorplan</a></h2>
                <p>Size is important, but it is the use of space that is more 
                important. &nbsp;A ceiling height of about 3 metres, a well-resolved 
                plan with no dead-spots, rooms that work for their intended 
                purpose, a good flow between spaces and a link between inside 
                and outside all contribute to a sense of comfort and space. 
                &nbsp;A balcony or courtyard is also a significant attribute, 
                but check that it is functional.</p>
                <p>There is also the practical aspect of judging space: will 
                your furniture fit? &nbsp;Display units use deceptive furnishings, 
                like 3/4 beds, in order to look bigger. &nbsp;Get a floorplan 
                and see if your furniture and appliances will fit. &nbsp;Also, 
                visualise going through your daily routine. &nbsp;One recent 
                buyer of a new inner city abode was amazed to find there was 
                no spot for the microwave and another looking for the cutlery 
                drawer in his flash new pad realised the kitchen didn't actually 
                have <i>any</i> drawers.</p>
                <p>A small entry hall or space is also an asset. &nbsp;It provides 
                privacy when someone comes to the door. &nbsp;Beware a floorplan 
                that puts a bathroom opposite the dining room or kitchen. &nbsp;In 
                a perfect world, you would have 2 bathrooms, one for guests. 
                &nbsp;Check that the bedrooms don't back onto lift shafts (it 
                does happen). &nbsp;Find out the layout of the neighboring unit. 
                &nbsp;Ideally, rooms with the same functions back onto each 
                other.</p>
                <p>There should be plenty of storage. &nbsp;If there are no 
                built-ins, be realistic about the space cupboards will take 
                up, physically and visually. &nbsp;Storage in a lock-up space 
                is perfect for items not used every day.</p>
