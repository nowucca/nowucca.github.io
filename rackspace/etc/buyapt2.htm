                <p>North and north-east are the best orientations. &nbsp;North 
                with views is even better. &nbsp;West facing apartments with 
                sun-control can also be fine. &nbsp;South facing apartments 
                are the only real no-no. &nbsp;You should get some sunlight 
                - it's absolutely critical. &nbsp;East-west apartments have 
                the possibility of east-facing bedrooms to catch morning light 
                and west-facing living area for afternoon sun. &nbsp;They also 
                offer through-ventilation. &nbsp;One should also consider whes are always 
                increasing. &nbsp;Wait is your proximity to other buildings? 
                &nbsp;Are you overlooking or overlooked? &nbsp;Units with attributes 
                like a view or a terrace will always be in more demand. &nbsp;When 
                the market is buoyant they will see above-normal growth.</p>
                <h2><a name="Amenities">Amenities</a></h2>
                <p>If an apartment has a car space or garage, make sure it is 
                on the title. &nbsp;If a unit has exclusive use of a terrace, 
                make sure it is noted in the strata bylaws. &nbsp;There is a 
                hundred people to argue with if anything goes wrong. &nbsp;Check 
                if there is visitor parking. &nbsp;Next best - is it easy to 
                park nearby? It is always better if there is more than one lift 
                in the building - and will your furniture fit into it? Also, 
                a new apartment should have Internet cabling and finally, make 
                sure the security system is easy to operate and makes you feel 
                safe.</p>

                <p>The Department of Fair Trading has received complaints about 
                many developers/builders. &nbsp;&quot;They all have been the 
                subject of consumer complaints relating to misrepresentation, 
                the provision of defective goods, over-charging and failure 
                to provide goods&quot;, it says. &nbsp;</p>
                <p>The Dept recommends getting good legal advice, particularly 
                when buying off the plan. &nbsp;Get the lawyer to check the 
                purchaser's right to rescind or reduce the salse price if promised 
                works that vary considerably. Lawyers should also check what 
                provisions there are if work is delayed and/or defective. &nbsp;A 
                certificate of home warranty insurance must be at 
                their aspect (outlook) is. &nbsp;Will you always have a view? 
                &nbsp;Particularly in inner-city areas where densitiprovided to purchasers 
                with contract of sale. &nbsp;An important difference when buying 
                off the plan is that the developer should obtain an exemption 
                so that the certificate of insurance can be provided at a later 
                stage ( but within 14 days of issue). &nbsp;A building inspection 
                is also recommeded as good consumer protection.</p>
                <p>Be aware that, with off-the-plan developments, there can 
                be a clause transferring purchaser's voting rights for future 
                management of the building.</p>
